/* Sharat Val
 * Period 2
 * 12/9/18
 * 
 * Overall this lab was challenging and fun at the same time. I think the
 * String Craft lab was more challenging for me. I think it was cool that
 * we got to create a text based version of solitaire. I was suprised I was
 * able to complete the save and load features without too much difficulty.
 * The hardest part of this lab was probably activity 5.
